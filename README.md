**About me and my work**
-------------
It all started back in the '90s with our first PC...a 386 with MS DOS.
Later we managed to get hands on a bit more powerful PC with Win95 and a 26k modem ; so much power but the programs and games are so restrictive, how nice would it be to create your own programs or change how they work...
So I stated modding my favorite games. In secondary school i choose informatics and mathematics as my advanced courses.
There I started with the programming language Turbo Pascal. During my A-levels I learned C/C++.

During my studies in Merseburg I first heard about Python as a niche language and learned Java, Assambler and a bit of C#.

During my work for CCN I became leadprogrammer for the Kindergaden software [KAI](https://www.kai.info/), written in Visual Foxpro.
